# Cost of Living Index Forecaster - Overview

The **Cost of Living Index Forecaster** is a machine learning-powered dashboard built using **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow**, and **Plotly**.  
It predicts **urban** and **rural** cost-of-living indices**, visualizes historical trends**, and provides **interactive statistics** for analytical insight.

The project combines **deep learning forecasting**, **responsive web design**, and **interactive data visualization**, suitable for research, educational, and analytical purposes.

## Interactive Statistics Panel

> Use this section in your Streamlit app for real-time exploration.

```python
if st.button("Show Interactive Statistics"):
    st.subheader("Descriptive Statistics")
    st.write(df.describe())

    st.subheader("Correlation Heatmap")
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", ax=ax)
    st.pyplot(fig)
```

This button dynamically displays descriptive statistics and correlation heatmaps, allowing users to visually inspect relationships in the dataset.

## Features

### 1. Forecasting and Analysis

* Uses a pre-trained **TensorFlow LSTM model** for time-series prediction.
* Predicts next-year **Urban** and **Rural** indices with historical trend alignment.
* Incorporates **ARIMA-like smoothing** for stable results.

### 2. Interactive Visualization

* Built entirely on **Plotly** and **Streamlit** components.
* Includes **animated gauge meters** for forecast display.
* Responsive layout optimized for desktop and tablet screens.

### 3. Theme Customization

* Dual-mode interface:

  * **Light Mode:** Pastel-beige background, soft shadowed cards.
  * **Dark Mode:** AMOLED-black base with neon accent gradients.
* Typography using **Playfair Display** and **Lora**.

### 4. Automated Statistics

* Summary metrics (mean, median, std deviation) auto-generated for both index categories.
* Live correlation analysis and trend decomposition.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * CSV file ingestion and feature scaling.
   * Missing values handled via forward filling.
   * Data split into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Architecture**

   * Implemented with **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks.
   * Optimized using **Adam optimizer** and **MSE loss**.
   * Saved model (`.h5`) loaded at runtime for fast inference.

3. **Visualization**

   * Plotly line and area charts for trend comparison.
   * Gauge charts for projected index values.
   * Glassmorphism-based UI for improved user experience.

## How to Use

1. Launch the Streamlit app.
2. Select the mode (Light or Dark).
3. View **Urban** and **Rural** forecasts.
4. Click on **“Show Interactive Statistics”** to view correlations and summary data.
5. Export predictions if required (optional extension).
